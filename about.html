    <h1 class="page-title">Who We Are</h1>

    <p class="fade-up">
      Socialexo is a digital growth and protection agency built for creators,
      influencers, brands, and businesses who demand more than visibility —
      they demand control, trust, and authority across social platforms.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-up delay-1">
      In a world where accounts are suspended, impersonated, or restricted
      without warning, we specialize in restoring digital presence and securing
      identities on major social networks.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-up delay-2">
      Our approach is precise, strategic, and platform-compliant. We don’t rely
      on shortcuts — we rely on expertise, relationships, and proven recovery
      workflows trusted by professionals.
    </p>

    <h2 class="page-subtitle">Our Vision</h2>

    <p class="fade-left">
      We envision a digital ecosystem where legitimate creators and brands never
      lose access to their voice. Socialexo exists to defend authenticity,
      recover digital assets, and empower growth without risk.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-left delay-1">
      Whether you are scaling your brand or protecting years of work, we stand
      between you and digital loss.
